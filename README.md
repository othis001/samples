# samples

This is a collection of solutions to some of my favorite programming problems. Here are the descriptions.

## boyGirl.cpp

This is a program that takes as input a string of the form
GGBGBB which represents a seating arrangment of boys and 
girls in row. The program will then calculate the minimum
numbers of swaps necessary to ensure K girls will be seated
together. Note we may only swap adjacent seats.

## connections.cpp

This function takes as input an array of positive integers that
represent positions of towns on a line and then an array of
their populations. We calculate the total amount of wire needed
to connect each person to each other person. 

## kSub.cpp

This is a program that takes as input an array and a
number K and determines how many subsequences have
sums that are divisible by K.

##matrixRoute.cpp

This function takes as input a matrix where each entry is either
0 or 1. We assume the top left and bottom right entries are 1 and
then count how many paths of 1s are between them. While on a path
we may only move right or down.

## polish.cpp

This is a simple program that implements a reverse polish calculator.

## querySystem.cpp

This is a program that implements a simple query system.

## robot.cpp

This is a program that if given directions for a robot
that it will repeatedly follow, will determine whether 
the robot will remain in a bounded area for all time.

## selfSimilarity.cpp

This is a program that takes as input a string and determines its self-similarity
or the total number of places in all the beginnings of its substrings that match
the whole string.

## subseqFlip.cpp

This is a program that takes a binary string as input and then
flips all the bits in a substring to obtain a new binary string
with the highest number of 1s.

## subsetsXOR.cpp

This is a program that takes an input an array of nonnegative integers.
It will then compute the sum of the XORs of all the subsets.

## stringPerm.cpp

This is a program that takes as input a string and then a list of positions
we are allowed to swap. It will then return the string with the highest
lexicographical order, we can obtain.

## weight.cpp

This is a program that takes as input an array and then
an array of weights where each weight corresponds to the
corresponding entry in the first array. We then return
the maximum weight formed by an INCREASING subsequence.
